# ECC
ECC c and Python implementation

The Python implementation is much easier to understand but it's pretty slow so I've also added a C-impl. .

The exception for the inf-point is added. So this can be used right now.

However, it is not hardend against side channel attacks, and there are mathematical transformations/algorithms, which could increment the exection speed even further.
